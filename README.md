# k8s-cluster-lab

Leverage the power of open-source projects to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on several virtual machines.

The goal of this lab is to enhance our understanding of Kubernetes and its practical implementation for production readiness. While we may have previously worked with lightweight Kubernetes distros such as Minikube, MicroK8s, or K3s, it is crucial to acknowledge that not all of them are suitable for production use and that some were specifically built for low resources machines.
